uint8 MODE_SINGLE = 1
uint8 MODE_CONTINUOUS = 2

uint8 mode              # Tying mode (use constants above)

# Result
bool success            # True if tying sequence succeeded
uint8 tied_count        # Number of rebar ties completed

---
# Feedback
string current_step     # Current step in sequence: "moving", "gripping", "tying", "releasing"
float32 progress        # Progress of current sequence (0.0 to 1.0)
